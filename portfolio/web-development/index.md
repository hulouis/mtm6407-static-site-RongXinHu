            Hello, my name is RongXinHu, and I am a recent graduate of the Interactive Media Design program at Algonquin College.
            I am passionate about web design and development, with a strong interest in creating user-friendly and visually appealing websites. Throughout my studies, I honed my skills in front-end development, responsive design, and user experience, while also gaining a solid foundation in coding languages like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and basic backend technologies.

          <p class="card-text">
            During my time at Algonquin College, I had the opportunity to work on various hands-on projects that allowed me to apply theoretical knowledge to real-world scenarios. These experiences not only improved my technical skills but also helped me develop strong problem-solving abilities and an eye for detail.
          </p>
          <p class="card-text">
            My ultimate goal is to build a career as a Web Designer or Web Developer, contributing to projects that enhance user experiences and bring innovative ideas to life. I am eager to learn and grow in this dynamic industry, continuously improving my expertise and staying updated with the latest technologies.
